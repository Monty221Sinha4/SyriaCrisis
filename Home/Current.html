        <h1>The Current Crisis</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Now in its 11th year, the Syrian refugee crisis remains the world’s largest refugee and displacement crisis of our time. Since the Syrian civil war officially began March 15, 2011, families have suffered under brutal conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people, torn the nation apart, and set back the standard of living by decades.

        About 6.8 million Syrians are refugees and asylum-seekers, and another 6.7 million people are displaced within Syria. This means 13.5 million Syrians in total are forcibly displaced, more than half of the country’s population. Nearly 11.1 million people in Syria need humanitarian assistance. And about half of the people affected by the Syrian refugee crisis are children.

        Healthcare centers and hospitals, schools, utilities, and water and sanitation systems are damaged or destroyed. Historic landmarks and once-busy marketplaces have been reduced to rubble. War severed the social and business ties that bound neighbors to their community.</p>

        <h1>Covid Pandemic</h1>
        <p>Coronavirus cases are surging to the worst levels of the pandemic in a rebel stronghold in Syria, a particularly devastating development in a region where dozens of hospitals have been bombed and that doctors and nurses have fled in droves during 10 years of war.

            The total number of cases seen in Idlib province, an overcrowded enclave with a population of four million, many of them internally displaced, has more than doubled since the beginning of August to more than 61,000.</p>

        <p>In recent weeks, daily new infections have repeatedly shot past 1,500, and authorities reported 34 deaths on Sunday alone, figures that are still believed to be undercounted because many infected people do not tell the authorities they are sick.

            The situation has become so dire in the northwestern province that rescue workers known as the White Helmets who became famous for digging through the rubble of bombings to find victims now mostly ferry coronavirus patients to the hospital or the dead to burials.
